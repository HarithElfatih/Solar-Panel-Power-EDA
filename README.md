# Solar-Panel-Power-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis for Solar Panel Power Generation

- **This project performs a time series analysis on monthly weather data to identify trends and cycles, assessing their impact on solar panel power generation.**
- **Analyzes weather conditions on the highest power generation day to understand correlations between weather factors and output power.**
- **Groups meteorological data by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) to enhance understanding and improve seasonal power generation forecasts.**
- **Examines data anomalies and unexpected trends to identify potential causes of variance in power generation predictions.**
